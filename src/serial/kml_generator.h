	 * @brief Generates KML files from FERS simulation scenarios for geographical visualization.
	 *
	 * This class generates KML files for geographical visualization of FERS scenarios. It
	 * interprets the simulation coordinates based on the user-specified coordinate system
	 * in the XML file, which can be one of:
	 *
	 * - ENU (East-North-Up): Default. Local Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are
	 *   treated as meters in an ENU tangent plane centered at a geodetic `<origin>`.
	 *
	 * - UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator): Coordinates (x, y, z) are treated as
	 *   easting (m), northing (m), and altitude (m) within a specified UTM zone and
	 *   hemisphere.
	 *
	 * - ECEF (Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed): Coordinates (x, y, z) are treated as
	 *   geocentric X, Y, Z values in meters.
	 *
	 * All input coordinates are converted to WGS84 geodetic coordinates (latitude,
	 * longitude, altitude) for the final KML output. The KML is written with
	 * `<altitudeMode>absolute</altitudeMode>`, where altitude is relative to Mean Sea
	 * Level (MSL).
