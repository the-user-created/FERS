/**
 * @class FersContext
 * @brief Manages the lifetime and state of a single FERS simulation scenario.
 *
 * This class serves as the C++ backend for the opaque `fers_context_t`
 * handle exposed by the C-API. The primary reason for its existence is to
 * apply the "Pimpl" (Pointer to Implementation) idiom at the ABI boundary. By
 * hiding the C++ standard library types (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::mt19937`) and
 * the full definition of `core::World` from the C header, we create a stable
 * ABI that does not break when the internal C++ implementation changes. This
 * encapsulation ensures that clients of the C-API (like Rust) do not need to be
 * recompiled if only the library's internals are modified.
 *
 * Its secondary role is to own the `core::World` object, which represents the
 * entire scenario, and the master random number generator. This guarantees that
 * the simulation state persists in memory between API calls and that randomness
 * can be controlled deterministically from a single source.
