 * @brief Provides functions to serialize and deserialize the simulation world to/from JSON.
 *
 * This module is the primary data interchange layer between the C++ core engine and
 * the user interface. JSON was chosen as the format for its native support in web
 * technologies (like the React/TypeScript frontend), its human-readability, and its
 * lightweight nature. This serializer defines the contract for how C++ simulation
 * objects are represented in JSON, enabling the UI to read, modify, and write
 * back the entire simulation state.

	 * frontend to consume. This involves translating internal data formats (e.g.,
	 * angles in radians) to a more UI-friendly format (e.g., compass degrees) and
	 * restructuring complex object relationships (like monostatic radars) into simpler

	 * replacement by clearing the existing world and rebuilding it from the provided
	 * JSON. This "replace" strategy simplifies state management, guaranteeing that the
	 * C++ core is always perfectly synchronized with the state provided by the UI without
	 * requiring complex diffing or patching logic. It also handles re-seeding the master
	 * random number generator to ensure that loading a state also restores its
	 * deterministic behavior.

	 * @param j The json object to deserialize.
	 * @param world The world object to populate.
	 * @param masterSeeder A reference to the master random number generator, which will be re-seeded.
