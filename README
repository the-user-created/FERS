FERS - The Flexible Extensible Radar Simulator

FERS is a simulator for simulating the performance and output of a variety of radar systems. It is designed to support a wide range of traditional and modern radar system designs. FERS is currently under active development - this version is likely to contain many bugs, incomplete or missing features, incomplete or missing documentation and major inaccuracies.

FERS is not currently mature enough to be used in a production environment. Please report any bugs you find, and we will get to fixing them as soon as possible. Documentation is currently very sparse - it will be improved soon.

The features which are currently implemented are:

* Creation of returns from arbitrary pulse shapes
* Simple propagation, doppler and phase model
* Modelling of Multistatic and Monostatic radar systems
* Modelling of CW and Pulsed radars
* Export to CSV, XML and HDF5 file formats
* Proper range-gate and timing for pulsed radars
* Modelling of propagation of clock and time signals between stations
* Effects of multipath propagation

Features in a state of partial implementation:
* Effects of Jitter and phase noise on timing sources

Features not implemented:
* Complete propagation model including fading

BUILDING FERS

FERS depends on a number of external libraries, which you need to install before attempting to build FERS. The libraries you need to have installed are:

* Boost (at least boost::threads and boost::random header) which is available freely from http://www.boost.org
* FFTW3 which is available freely from http://www.fftw3.org
* libhdf5

On a Debian or Ubuntu system (or pretty much any other decent GNU/Linux distribution) these libraries should be available pre-packaged for your installing pleasure.

FERS also depends on the cmake system. This system can generate makefiles, VC++ projects, KDevelop projects and more from the FERS sources. Please install cmake before attempting to build FERS.

Now type

cmake ./

followed by

make

FERS is written in standard C++ and should compile and run on many architectures and operating systems. Please report successes and failures of running this software on non-Linux and non-x86 platforms to the authors, so we can improve the software and make it more portable.

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is available in the doc/ directory. Highlights include:

doc/equations/equations.tex - All equations used by FERS in convenient LaTeX form
fersxml.dtd - Document Type Definition for the XML script file format

THANKS

The authors of tinyXml, FFTW and Boost for making excellent software freely available.
