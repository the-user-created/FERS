FERS - The Flexible Extensible Radar Simulator

FERS is a simulator for simulating the performance and output of a variety of radar systems. It is designed to support a wide range of traditional and modern radar system designs. FERS is currently under heavy development, and is likely to change fairly quickly.

FERS is not currently mature enough to be used in a production environment. Please report any bugs you find, and we will get to fixing them as soon as possible. Documentation is currently very sparse - it will be improved very soon.

The features which are currently (at least partially implemented are):

* Creation of returns from arbitrary pulse shapes
* Simple propagation, doppler and phase model
* Modelling of Multistatic and Monostatic radar systems
* Modelling of CW and Pulsed radars
* Export to CSV, XML and HDF5 file formats

Features not implemented:

* Proper range-gate and timing for pulsed radars (coming very soon)
* Complex propagation model including fading and multipath
* Modelling of propagation of clock and time signals between stations
* Effects of Jitter and phase noise on timing sources

BUILDING FERS

FERS depends on a number of external libraries, which you need to install before attempting to build FERS. The libraries you need to have installed are:

* Boost (at least boost::threads and the boost/cstdint.hpp header) which is available freely from http://www.boost.org
* FFTW3 which is available freely from http://www.fftw3.org
* libsamplerate which is available freely from http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
* libhdf5 (optional, for export to Hierarchical Data Format 5 files)

On a Debian or Ubuntu system (or pretty much any other decent GNU/Linux distribution) these libraries should be available pre-packaged for your installing pleasure.

Once you have these libraries installed, type:

./configure

followed by

make

FERS is written in standard C++ and should compile and run on many architectures and operating systems. Please report successes and failures of running this software on non-Linux and non-x86 platforms to the authors, so we can improve the software and make it more portable.

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is available in the doc/ directory. Highlights include:

doc/equations/equations.tex - All equations used by FERS in convenient LaTeX form
fersxml.dtd - Document Type Definition for the XML script file format

THANKS

The authors of tinyXml, FFTW, Boost and Secret Rabbit Code for making excellent software freely available.
